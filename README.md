# SUSE Apprentices Timesheets made easy

## Installation
+ If you just want to start right away:
  `pip install azubi-timesheet`
+ Development mode:
  1. `git clone https://github.com/eliroca/azubi-timesheet.git; cd azubi-timesheet`
  2. `pip install -e .`

## Contributions are welcome
   + [ ] Subcommand `export` should accept date without day, like this `-d 10.2019`
   + [ ] Possibility to add more days with one command for vacation, etc.
   + [ ] Raise exceptions in `timesheet.py` and catch them in main, instead of exiting the program
   + [ ] Reformat code with black: https://pypi.org/project/black
   + [ ] Implement working hours carryover(Stunden√ºbertrag)
   + Update: early implementation does the job, but it can't extract the value from previous month unless:
      you exported the previous month already AND opened the previous xlsx file AND Ctrl+S to save it,
      so that the calculated values of all formulas are saved. Not quite ideal.
   + [x] Better separate the main script (azubi-timesheet.py) from a module (timesheet.py)
   + [x] Adding "special" days like: vacation, school; only date and comment needed for that
   + [x] Method to fill in records from json file to xlsx exported file
   + [x] Method to create file names like `timesheet_2019_10.json` `timesheet_2019_10.xlsx` and implement where needed
   + [x] Method to load specific json files of the given date's month and year
