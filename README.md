   + [x] Adding "special" days like: vacation, school; only date and comment needed for that
   + [x] Method to fill in records from json file to xlsx exported file
   + [x] Method to create file names like `timesheet_2019_10.json` `timesheet_2019_10.xlsx` and implement where needed
   + [x] Method to load specific json files of the given date's month and year


## Structure
